<title>Responsive vs. Mobile</title>
<h1>Responsive vs. Mobile</h1>
<p>	Html web page design will include all devices with an computer operating system compatible to internet browser standards.  The web designer will have to make a choice on who the audience will be who view their web pages.  When making this choice.  The option to choose Responsive web design or Mobile HTML application web site design with extra co-communication linking.
	Erich a web development writer explains it like this “Responsive; A design style that responds and conforms for all devices. Known as “RWD, Mobile version sub-site; A top level website with a mobile version inside a folder.  Sometimes called “Adaptive Web Design” (Erich).   For Mobile version sub-site the smart phone does not load the full web site code into its browser.   It uses a link to another server to do the loading and rendering for the smart phone making the phone easer to use.   When calling the web page up.
	Responsive design will have less images and content to meet the demand of smaller devices.   This means designing and testing each device your audience will be using to keep up with the mobile compliant comparisons.  Some phone owners will check to see if site is mole compliant before opening a web page.   All this must be considered by the web development team or owners before making such web pages.   
	Mobil version sub-site design users some times prefer using the desktop size websites.  They remember how to get to the content they need and just us it that way.
According to the Nielsen Norman Group, “ And sometimes people may be so used to the full site that they can use this prior knowledge to figure out their way around on a small screen” (Nielsen Norman Group).  This kind of thinking has lead smaller companies to not use the responsive design method when hosting web pages to clients or the general public.  While big corporations will make responsive design to reach the broader audience as part of their web design teams.
